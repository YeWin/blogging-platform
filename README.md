# blogging-platform

Small blogging application, created for the purposes of [Tidy Java](http://tidyjava.com) blog. If you want to learn more
about how it's designed and built, there's no better place than the
[Blogging Platform series](http://tidyjava.com/tag/blogging-platform/). Project is Open Source
and "Unlicensed", so anybody can contribute or create her/his own project based on this one.


## Build & Run
To build the project, you can use the following command:
```
gradle assemble
```

To run the project use:
```
gradle bootRun
```

Or run `BloggingPlatform` class from your IDE. 

## Contribution guidelines
Coding style:
* Use Intellij's default formatting settings. If you're using a different IDE, make sure to configure it accordingly.

How to get started?
* Get the project.
* Write some good code.
* Issue a pull request.

I will try to keep a backlog in the issues tab, so that anybody can find herself/himself a task if he wants to.
